      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
    
        I’m a senior at the University of Minnesota-Duluth majoring Computer Science, while minoring in Management Information Systems,
        with interests in product management, cloud, and design. 
        I like bridging the gap between people and technology, translating user needs into clear goals and practical solutions. 
        I’m aiming for product management or technical project/product roles where I can combine analytical thinking with strong teamwork and communication.

      </p>
      <p>
        I bring strong communication, leadership, and structured problem-solving to team environments. 
        From being President and a Student Leader for my club, as well as taking initiative in being a Product Owner in my systems class, I’m used to coordinating tasks, 
        gathering input, and turning ideas into clear plans that teams can execute. 
        I value ownership, consistency, and clear expectations, especially when stakeholder requirements, timelines, and priorities change.
      </p>
